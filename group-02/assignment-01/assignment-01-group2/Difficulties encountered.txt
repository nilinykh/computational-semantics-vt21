1. Propositional logic


statement 4:"If Alex or George plays the piano, they are musical."
 It is ambiguous.Does "they" refer to the one who plays the piano or to both of them here? 
This bit is confusing. we decided to go with both of them but this can be translated both ways.


2. Valuation of Propositional logic


Comments: All sentences from Question 1 are True except 'If Alex or George plays the piano, 
they are musical.' which makes sense, because George plays the piano and George is not musical.


3. Predicate logic without quantifiers


 Statement 2: "Lydia likes herself and so does George" is ambiguous.
we weren't sure in the second sentence if the meaning was that George liked himself or Lydia.
 
statement 3: "Charlie is an English pianist" we weren't sure if it was better to represent 
it with a single predicate or to split it in two predicates. 
So we decided to split in two. (pianist() and english())


4. First order logic with quantifiers

statement 2:
It could be written as: 'all x. exists y. (admires(George,x) & - admires(Lydia,y))' and still give the same result
Use "-x" to express no one (when "x" means everybody)

statement 4:
We don't know how to represent "exactly one.
how to properly create a link for "playing everything that alex wrote" between playing and what he actually wrote
